### Compliance Statement

### The ggml-hexagon way

- Simple is beautiful

  we believe the philosophy of "<b>simple is beautiful</b>" which <b>comes from the great Unix</b>.

- Make it run, then make it right, then make it fast

- Explore and have fun!

  we believe the philosophy of <b>try crazy ideas, build wild demos, and push the edge of whatâ€™s possible</b>(which is one of the core spirits of ggml-way).

- The rule-based order

  we respect the rule-based order and we respect the IPR.
