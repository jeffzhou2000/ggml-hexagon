### Compliance Statement

Currently, Qualcomm's Hexagon SDK can't downloaded automatically via the script [build-run-android.sh](https://github.com/zhouwg/ggml-hexagon/blob/self-build/scripts/build-run-android.sh) because of well-known and make-sense IPR policy. I provide a customized&tailored minimal Hexagon SDK to **simplify workflow** of build ggml-hexagon under the premise of **strictly abiding by Qualcomm's IPR policy.**
